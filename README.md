# IC Grant Delivery
## Decentralized Content Bundle

## Preface
All 3 milestones are closely connected and it is an incremental development of the Decentralized Content Bundle. 
And each subsequent milestone is an incremental enhancement or development of the new features according to the main aim. The entire project will contains backend canisters and frontend canisters.


***
## Attention:
_Only some backend changes were done in the scope of the 1st milestone. But some subdirectories were already reserved. Also, some changes were done in the separate existing product ics2 (https://github.com/sergeybykov85/ic-storage-service) in the scope of this 1st milestone as it was declared. This branch contains some screens of the build-in html interface of the backend canister. Sure, frontend canisters will be created as declared but in the next milestones_
